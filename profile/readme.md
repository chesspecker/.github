### Hello devs from around the world 🌍

This is an open-source chess training app heavily using [Lichess](https://github.com/ornicar/lila).

### Next steps ⚡️

We are currently re-building the app, optimizing how the backend and frontend communicates in order to make changes implementation much easier.

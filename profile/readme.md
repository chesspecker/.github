### Hello devs from around the world üåç

This is an open-source chess training app heavily using [Lichess](https://github.com/ornicar/lila).

There is four repositories :
1. [frontend](https://github.com/chesspecker/frontend): a react app using next and deployed via vercel
2. [backend](https://github.com/chesspecker/backend): a node js rest api using express to communicate with mongoDB
3. [lichess-puzzler](https://github.com/chesspecker/lichess-puzzler): a fork implementing the analysis of games and generation of puzzles pulled from mongoDB
4. [lichess-database-processing](https://github.com/chesspecker/lichess-database-processing): Export puzzles from lichess CSV file to a mongo database

### Next steps ‚ö°Ô∏è

Our roadmap is to focus on three main versions.

- V1 will let player create an account and play a set of puzzles pulled from the lichess database.
- V2 will let player generate puzzles from their own games.
- V3 will also let player train chess openings.
